<h1>Concatenated Words</h1>
<p>
This page explains Java solution to problem <code class="inline">Concatenated Words</code> using <code class="inline">Dynamic Programming</code> algorithm.
</p>


<h2 class="heading">Problem Statement</h2>
<p>
Given a list of words (without duplicates), please write a program that returns all concatenated words in the given list of words.
</p>
<p>
A concatenated word is defined as a string that is comprised entirely of at least two shorter words in the given array.
</p>

<b>Example 1:</b>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Input</b>: ["cat","cats","catsdogcats","dog","dogcatsdog","hippopotamuses","rat","ratcatdogcat"] <br/>
<b>Output</b>: ["catsdogcats","dogcatsdog","ratcatdogcat"] <br/>
<b>Explanation</b>: <br/>
"catsdogcats" can be concatenated by "cats", "dog" and "cats"; <br />
"dogcatsdog" can be concatenated by "dog", "cats" and "dog"; <br />
"ratcatdogcat" can be concatenated by "rat", "cat", "dog" and "cat" <br />
