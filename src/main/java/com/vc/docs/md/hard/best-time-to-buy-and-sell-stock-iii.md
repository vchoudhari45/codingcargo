<h1>Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III</h1>
<p>
This page explains Java solution to problem <code class="inline">Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III</code> using <code class="inline">Dynamic Programming</code> algorithm.
</p>


<h2 class="heading">Problem Statement</h2>
<p>
Say you have an array for which the <code class="inline">ith</code> element is the price of a given stock on day <code class="inline">i</code>.
</p>
<p>
Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two transactions.
</p>
<p>
Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).
</p>

<b>Example 1:</b>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Input</b>: prices = [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]<br/>
<b>Output</b>: 6<br/>
<b>Explanation</b>: <br/>
Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3. <br />
Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3. <br />
</p>
</blockquote>

<b>Example 2:</b>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Input</b>: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]<br/>
<b>Output</b>: 4<br/>
<b>Explanation</b>: <br />
Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
