<h1>Number of Islands II</h1>
<p>
This page explains Java solution to problem <code class="inline">Number of Islands II</code> using <code class="inline">Union Find</code> algorithm.
</p>


<h2 class="heading">Problem Statement</h2>
<p>
A <code class="inline">2d</code> grid map of <code class="inline">m</code> rows and <code class="inline">n</code> columns is initially filled with water. We may perform an addLand operation which turns the water at position (row, col) into a land. Given a list of positions to operate, count the number of islands after each addLand operation. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. 
</p>
<p>
You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.
</p>

<b>Example 1:</b>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Input</b>: m = 3, n = 3, positions = [[0,0], [0,1], [1,2], [2,1]]<br/>
<b>Output</b>: [1,1,2,3]<br/>
</p>
