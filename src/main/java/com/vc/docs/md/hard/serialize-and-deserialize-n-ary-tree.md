<h1>Serialize and Deserialize N-ary Tree</h1>
<p>
This page explains Java solution to problem <code class="inline">Serialize and Deserialize N-ary Tree</code> using <code class="inline">Tree</code> data structure.
</p>


<h2 class="heading">Problem Statement</h2>
<p>
Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.
</p>
<p>
Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize an N-ary tree. An N-ary tree is a rooted tree in which each node has no more than N children. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that an N-ary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be de-serialized to the original tree structure.

<b>Example 1:</b>
<b>Input</b>: <br />
<img title="" src="####BASEURL####serde-n-tree/serde-n-tree.jpg" alt="Serialize and Deserialize N-ary Tree Input" />
<br />
<b>Output</b>: <br />
<code class="inline">public String serialize(Node root)</code><br />
Above function can serialize input tree as [1,3&nbsp;&nbsp;3,2&nbsp;&nbsp;5,0&nbsp;&nbsp;6,0&nbsp;&nbsp;2,0&nbsp;&nbsp;4,0] <br />
